As of this point I have never run more than 2 or 3 ProxMox VM's at one time and they have basically been some combination of miscellaneous docker installs (the sorts of things that should probably go on a true Lab VM), a Plex Media Server, and the original PFSense VM that ran side by side with my other VM. I briefly tried to start an LXC container one time, but after not finding any templates in "local" in the wizard after searching for about 5 minutes for solutions I gave up and just made another VM.

Today I tried again for the first time and initially coudln't figure out where to even begin to install dependencies to get Docker going. A search for a bash script to install dependencies led to finding this web site for the first time:

    https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/

Holy crap. I ran the Docker LXC Script dated 5/1/2024 and quickly have a fully functioning Docker/Portainer setup. I'm sure I will find even better ways to do what I want, but for now this is a huge improvement.
