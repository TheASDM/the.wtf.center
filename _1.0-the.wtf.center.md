# the.wtf.center - Network Configuration v1.0

Recent efforts focused on stabilizing and formalizing the network. This involved simplifying physical connections (removing ~40 patch cables) and replacing a larger 18-port managed switch with a more focused 6-port smart switch. The primary goal is to segregate the network into production (critical devices, WiFi via Omada) and testing/server environments.

## Immediate Future Plans (Network Refinement)

1.  **MokerLink 6-Port (Core):**
    *   `Port 1` -> Omada Switch (`Port 1` - Uplink)
2.  **MokerLink 10GbE (Server/NAS):**
    *   `Port 3` -> Re-purpose (destination TBD, currently Wife's VLAN direct access).
3.  **Omada TL-SG2008 V3 / TL-SG2210P (Omada Network):**
    *   `Port 1`: Uplink from MokerLink 6-Port (`Port 1`).
    *   `Port 2`: Unmanaged switch for Wife's personal devices (VLAN 14).
    *   `Port 3`: TP-Link EAP650 (VLANs 11, 14, 30, 44, 99).
    *   `Port 4`: Nvidia Shield (VLAN TBD).
4.  **Omada Software Controller:**
    *   `Software Defined Networking (SDN)`: All Omada traffic will be controlled by TP-Link Omada Software Defined Networking (SDN) on ProxMox LXC Container

## Distant Future Plans (Learning & Expansion)

1.  **True Network Segregation:** Direct OPNsense connections to both MokerLink 6-port (Test/Server) and Omada switch (Production/Critical) using separate NICs.
2.  **Link Aggregation (LAGG/LACP):** Implement for increased bandwidth/resiliency to servers/NAS.
3.  **Advanced Networking:** Deepen understanding of Layer 2/3 concepts, IGMP Snooping, etc.

## Key Lessons Learned

1.  **VLAN Tagging Strategy:**
    *   **Non-VLAN-aware devices:** Assign to a VLAN by setting the switch port to *untagged* for that VLAN.
    *   **VLAN-aware devices:** *Tag* all relevant VLANs on the switch port. If the device requires a "native" or "untagged" VLAN for its management, set it to an unused VLAN ID on the switch port and configure the device accordingly.
2.  **Proxmox VLANs:** Requires a VLAN-aware NIC & bridge setup.
    *   One NIC/bridge on an untagged Admin VLAN (static IP for Proxmox host).
    *   Second NIC/bridge (VLAN-aware, no host IP) with all necessary VLANs tagged, for VMs/LXCs.
3.  **PVID:** Always ensure the Port VLAN ID (PVID) on a switch port matches the intended untagged VLAN.
4.  **Static IPs:** Prefer OPNsense DHCP static mappings over device-configured static IPs for easier management and recovery.
5.  **Segregation is Key:** Separate Production and Testing networks are essential for a stable homelab.

## OPNsense: VLANs Across Multiple LAN NICs (Bridging)

**Goal:** Create distinct "Production" and "Testing" LAN segments using two physical NICs on OPNsense (`ix3`, `ix5`), while allowing inter-VLAN routing controlled by OPNsense.

**Method:**
1.  **VLAN Creation:** For each required VLAN (e.g., VLAN 11), create it on *both* parent physical interfaces:
    *   `vlan11onix3` (Parent: `ix3`)
    *   `vlan11onix5` (Parent: `ix5`)
    *   Repeat for all VLANs (14, 20, 30, 44, 99).
2.  **Bridge Creation:** In OPNsense (`Interfaces > Other Types > Bridge`):
    *   Create a bridge for each VLAN pair (e.g., `vlan11bridge`).
    *   Add the corresponding VLAN interfaces as members (e.g., `vlan11onix3` and `vlan11onix5` to `vlan11bridge`).
3.  **Interface Assignment & Configuration:**
    *   Assign the newly created bridge (e.g., `vlan11bridge`) as a new interface in OPNsense.
    *   Disable/remove IP configurations from the individual VLAN-on-physical-NIC interfaces.
    *   Configure the static IP, DHCP server, and other settings on the *bridge interface*.
4.  **Firewall & DNS:**
    *   Ensure DNS Resolver/Forwarder is listening on the bridge interfaces.
    *   Create appropriate firewall rules for traffic to/from/across the bridge interfaces (e.g., allow bridge to WAN).

**Outcome:** Traffic on VLAN 11 arriving at OPNsense via `ix3` can be routed to devices on VLAN 11 connected via `ix5` (and other VLANs as per firewall rules), effectively extending the VLAN across two physical LAN segments.
*(Initial plan was to use this for full Prod/Test split, but currently, both NICs effectively feed into the main switch path. Long-term goal is to physically separate these paths post-OPNsense.)*
