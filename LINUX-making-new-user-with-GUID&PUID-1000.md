Here's the best way to create a user with UID 1000 and GID 1000 on your Proxmox VE host:

**1. Check if UID 1000 or GID 1000 are already in use on PVE**

It's crucial to ensure these IDs aren't already taken by another user or group on your PVE host.
Open a shell on your PVE host (via SSH or the console) and run:

```bash
getent passwd 1000
getent group 1000
```

*   If both commands return nothing, you're clear to use UID 1000 and GID 1000.
*   If `getent passwd 1000` returns a user, that UID is taken. You'll have a conflict.
*   If `getent group 1000` returns a group, that GID is taken. You might be able to use this existing group if its purpose aligns, or you'll need to reconsider.

Assuming UID 1000 and GID 1000 are free (which is likely if you only have `root` and system users):

**2. Create the Group (if it doesn't exist or you want a specific name)**

If GID 1000 isn't in use, or if it is but it's a generic group name you don't want to associate with this user, create a new group. Let's call the group `nasgroup` (you can choose another name).

```bash
sudo groupadd -g 1000 nasgroup
```
If GID 1000 *is* already in use by a group that makes sense (e.g., if your first user on a Debian system was `pveadmin` with UID/GID 1000), you might skip this and use that existing group GID in the next step. However, for clarity, creating a specific group is often better.

**3. Create the User**

Now, create the user. Let's call the user `nasuser`.

```bash
sudo useradd -u 1000 -g 1000 -m -s /bin/bash nasuser
```
Let's break down these options:
*   `-u 1000`: Sets the User ID (UID) to 1000.
*   `-g 1000`: Sets the primary Group ID (GID) to 1000 (this should match the GID of `nasgroup` you created, or an existing group with GID 1000).
*   `-m`: Creates the user's home directory (e.g., `/home/nasuser`). This is generally good practice, even if the user won't log in interactively often.
*   `-s /bin/bash`: Sets the user's default login shell. If this user will *never* log in, you could use `/usr/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false`. However, `/bin/bash` can be useful for temporary `su - nasuser` for testing permissions.
*   `nasuser`: The username.

**Alternative if you want the user's primary group to have the same name as the user and GID 1000 (common practice):**

First, ensure GID 1000 is free or you've deleted any group using it.
Then, you can use the `-U` option with `useradd` which creates a group with the same name as the user:

```bash
# Ensure GID 1000 is free if a group already exists with it that you don't want
# sudo groupdel <existing_group_name_if_any_at_gid_1000>

sudo useradd -u 1000 -U -m -s /bin/bash nasuser
```
This command will:
1.  Attempt to create a group `nasuser` with GID 1000 (if GID 1000 is available for a new group).
2.  Create the user `nasuser` with UID 1000 and primary GID `nasuser` (which is 1000).

**4. Set a Password (Optional but Recommended)**

Even if you don't plan for this user to log in interactively, setting a password is good security hygiene.

```bash
sudo passwd nasuser
```
Follow the prompts to set a strong password.

**5. Verify**

Check that the user and group were created correctly:

```bash
id nasuser
ls -ld /home/nasuser
```
The `id nasuser` command should show `uid=1000(nasuser) gid=1000(nasgroup_or_nasuser) groups=1000(nasgroup_or_nasuser)`.
The `ls -ld /home/nasuser` should show the home directory owned by `nasuser:nasgroup_or_nasuser`.

**Why this helps:**

*   **NFS Permissions:** When PVE mounts the NFS share, files created by UID 1000 on the NAS will be seen as owned by `nasuser` on the PVE host. This makes `ls -l` output meaningful.
*   **LXC Containers (Privileged):** If you run privileged LXC containers, UIDs/GIDs are not mapped; they are the same as on the host. So, a process running as UID 1000 inside a privileged LXC will directly interact with the NFS mount as UID 1000 on the PVE host, which then translates correctly to the NAS.
*   **LXC Containers (Unprivileged) with Bind Mounts:** If PVE mounts the NFS share (e.g., to `/mnt/mynas`) and you bind-mount a subdirectory into an unprivileged LXC, the permissions seen by the container depend on the mapping.
    *   If you configure your LXC's UID/GID map to map container UID 1000 to host UID 1000 (e.g., `lxc.idmap: u 0 100000 1000`, `lxc.idmap: u 1000 1000 1`, `lxc.idmap: g 0 100000 1000`, `lxc.idmap: g 1000 1000 1`, and configure `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` on PVE to allow `root` to map host UID/GID 1000), then it will work seamlessly. This is more advanced.
    *   More commonly, for unprivileged containers, a process inside the container (e.g., UID 1000) gets mapped to a higher host UID (e.g., 101000). In this case, for the *container* to have write access, the files on the NFS share (and thus on PVE's mount of it) would need to be owned by host UID 101000. Creating `nasuser` (UID 1000) on PVE doesn't directly solve this unprivileged LXC mapping issue unless you specifically map it. However, PVE's `root` or `nasuser` (if PVE mounts the share as `nasuser`) might still need to *prepare* the data for the container.
*   **VMs:** For VMs, the NFS client runs *inside* the VM's OS. The VM's user (UID 1000) will authenticate with the NFS server. PVE having a matching UID 1000 user is mostly relevant if the VM's virtual disk images are stored on that NFS share and PVE itself needs to manage those files (e.g., backups, snapshots done by PVE).
*   **Proxmox VE Storage:** If you add the NFS share as a storage target in Proxmox VE (Datacenter -> Storage -> Add -> NFS), Proxmox tasks (like backups) will run as `root` on the PVE host.
    *   If your NAS export has `root_squash` (default and recommended), `root` on PVE will be mapped to `nobody` or `nfsnobody` on the NAS, and likely won't be able to write to files owned by UID 1000.
    *   If your NAS export has `no_root_squash` (less secure), `root` on PVE will be `root` on the NAS, and can do anything.
    *   Having the `nasuser` on PVE doesn't change how PVE's `root` user interacts with the NFS share unless you explicitly make `root` `su` to `nasuser` or use mount options to specify the mounting UID/GID (which isn't typical for PVE's direct storage integrations). However, it ensures that when PVE *reads* metadata or files, the ownership is displayed correctly.

By creating this user on PVE, you establish a clear and consistent understanding of UID/GID 1000 across your systems, which simplifies permission management and troubleshooting.
