# Rclone: A Superior Alternative to Rsync for Modern File Transfers

I searched multiple times for easy ways to transfer files to and from my seedbox and was constantly directed to `rsync.`  While it worekd better than somme alternatives I used (SyncThing, Resillio Sync, etc) I found that installing filebrowser on the 2 systems and selecting multiple files to download at one time was faster. But that was manual and a huge pain. 

When I needed to backup 15tb's to the cloud I became frustrated around 7tb's in and 10 days later. I was willing to finish the backup, but the plan was to change OS's on my NAS and knowing I would have to download the stuff back to it made me look into just getting a single 20tb drive and doing it all locally. After doing some precise searching and AI prompting I learned that the reason I was only able to max out at 16mb/s was due to the nature of `rsync` over ssh. There was an alternative though:`rclone` 

**My personal experience saw a dramatic speed increase: from ~16 MB/s with `rsync` to ~115 MB/s with `rclone` when transferring large media libraries between my NAS and a seedbox.** This was primarily achieved by leveraging `rclone`'s built-in parallelism.

## Why Rclone Often Outperforms Rsync

1.  **Parallelism by Default:** `rclone` is designed to perform multiple operations (transfers, checks) concurrently.
    *   `--transfers=N`: Specifies the number of file transfers to run in parallel.
    *   `--checkers=N`: Specifies the number of checkers to run in parallel (for comparing source and destination).
    `rsync` is largely single-threaded for the actual data transfer phase.

2.  **Designed for "Remotes":** While `rsync` excels at local-to-local or SSH-based transfers, `rclone` supports a vast array of "remotes," including:
    *   Cloud storage (S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.)
    *   SFTP/SSH (like `rsync`)
    *   WebDAV
    *   FTP
    *   And many more.
    Its architecture is optimized for interacting with these various APIs and protocols efficiently.

3.  **Versatile Feature Set:**
    *   **Mounting Remotes:** `rclone mount` allows you to mount any configured remote as a local filesystem (using FUSE), making remote files accessible like local ones.
    *   **Server-Side Operations:** For supported remotes, `rclone` can perform server-side copies/moves, saving bandwidth.
    *   **Encryption:** Built-in client-side encryption.
    *   **Deduplication:** Can find and manage duplicate files.
    *   **Filtering:** Powerful include/exclude rules.

4.  **Efficient Checking:** Options like `--size-only` can speed up checks if modification times aren't reliable or precise checksums aren't needed for every sync.

## Rsync's Strengths (and When It Might Still Be Ideal)

`rsync` is still an excellent tool, particularly for:
*   **Delta Transfers within Files:** Its core algorithm efficiently transfers only the changed *parts* of files, which is invaluable for large files with small modifications (e.g., database backups, VM images). `rclone` typically re-transfers the entire file if it has changed.
*   **Mature & Ubiquitous:** Often pre-installed on Linux/macOS systems.
*   **Fine-grained control over permissions/attributes** for POSIX systems.

However, for bulk transfers, especially over networks where latency or per-file overhead is a factor, `rclone`'s parallelism often gives it a decisive speed advantage.

## Key Rclone Commands

Here are the commands that I am already using. I am sure I am just scratching the surface, but this has done what I need for now:

### 1. Installation

```bash
curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```
This is the recommended way to install/update `rclone` on Linux/macOS.

### 2. Configuration Setup

```bash
rclone config
```
This interactive command walks you through setting up your "remotes" (connections to your storage locations like your NAS, seedbox, cloud services, etc.). You'll define names for these remotes (e.g., `NAS`, `Seedbox`).

### 3. Transfer: NAS to Seedbox (Example)

```bash
rclone copy /volume2/media/movies Seedbox:/home14/theasdm/movies-backup \
    --transfers=8 \
    --checkers=8 \
    --size-only \
    --progress
```
*   `rclone copy <source> <destination>`: Copies files.
*   `/volume2/media/movies`: Local path on the NAS (source).
*   `Seedbox:/home14/theasdm/movies-backup`: `Seedbox` is the rclone remote name, followed by the path on that remote (destination).
*   `--transfers=8`: Use 8 parallel file transfers.
*   `--checkers=8`: Use 8 parallel checkers (to compare files before transfer).
*   `--size-only`: Skips checking files based on hash/modtime if sizes are identical. Faster if modtimes aren't reliable or full hashing isn't needed.
*   `--progress`: Show real-time progress.

### 4. Transfer: Seedbox to NAS (Example)

```bash
rclone copy Seedbox:/home14/theasdm/movies-backup /volume2/media/movies \
    --transfers=8 \
    --checkers=8 \
    --progress \
    --stats=10s
```
*   Similar to the above, but direction is reversed.
*   `--stats=10s`: Print statistics every 10 seconds.

### 5. Mount Remote as a Local Drive

```bash
rclone mount Seedbox:/home14/theasdm/movies-backup ~/mnt/seedbox \
    --vfs-cache-mode writes \
    --allow-other &
```
*   `rclone mount <remote:path> <local_mount_point>`: Mounts the remote.
*   `~/mnt/seedbox`: Local directory where the seedbox files will appear.
*   `--vfs-cache-mode writes`: Caches files being written to the remote. Other modes include `off`, `minimal`, `full`. `writes` is a good balance for many use cases, improving upload reliability.
*   `--allow-other`: (Optional) Allows non-root users to access the mount. May require `user_allow_other` in `/etc/fuse.conf`.
*   `&`: (Optional) Runs the command in the background.

## Conclusion

While `rsync` has its place, `rclone` offers compelling advantages in speed (especially due to parallelism) and versatility for a wide range of modern file transfer and synchronization tasks. If you're dealing with cloud storage, network shares, or just want faster bulk transfers, giving `rclone` a try is highly recommended. The performance gains can be substantial.
